# **Welcome to the MZmine 3 wiki!**

MZmine 3 is an open-source and platform-independent software for mass spectrometry (MS) data
processing and visualization. It enables large-scale metabolomics and lipidomics research by
spectral preprocessing, feature detection, and various options for compound identification,
including spectral library querying and creation.

Since the introduction of MZmine 2 in 2010, the project has matured into a into a community-driven,
highly collaborative platform and its functions continue to expand based on the MS community needs
and feedbacks. This progress was made possible by the invaluable contribution of
many [developers](https://github.com/mzmine/mzmine3/graphs/contributors) from research labs
distributed all over the world.

## **What's new compared to MZmine 2?**

MZmine 3 comes with a redesigned and fully customizable [GUI](main-window-overview.md) based on the
JavaFX technology that allow an interactive visualization and validation of results from every
processing step.

A completely new data structure provides the flexibility to process any type of mass spectrometry,
including LC-MS, GC-MS and MS-imaging. Moreover, MZmine 3 now support ion mobility, with a
dedicated [LC-IM-MS data visualization](visualization_modules/ims_raw_data_overview/im-data-visualisation.md)
module and [feature detection](workflows/imsworkflow/ion-mobility-data-processing-workflow.md)
algorithms. While offering numerous new data analysis options, significant effort was also devoted
to trace memory issues and bottlenecks, resulting in an unprecendent processing performance and
scalability.

Finally, recent developments have strengthened the ties to other open source projects, including
the [GNPS](https://gnps.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/static/gnps-splash.jsp) platform with Ion Identity
Molecular Networking and the [SIRIUS](https://bio.informatik.uni-jena.de/software/sirius/) suite
for _in silico_ metabolite annotation.

## **About this documentation**

Here you can find documentation for both [processing](module_docs)
and [visualization](visualization_modules) modules in MZmine 3.
Moreover, [data processing pipelines](workflows) for
untargeted [LC-MS](workflows/lcmsworkflow/lcms-workflow.md)
and [LC-IMS-MS](workflows/imsworkflow/ion-mobility-data-processing-workflow.md) feature detection
are described and general recommendations are given.

**COMING SOON!** We are currently working on a series of short videotutorials to help get you
started with the main features of MZmine 3!
