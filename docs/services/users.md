# Users management

The sign up is available
directly in the mzmine **Users** menu (Manage users). If you experience any issues with the built-in
webview, click the
external browser button and sign up online. Briefly, the user needs to provide few details
including:

- **Username**: Fixed identifier that cannot be changed
- **Define your use case**: The intended use of this user profile, either **commercial use** or *
  *non-profit academic use**
- **Email**: Either an academic or company email address. It is important to use an
  academic email address to gain a non-profit academic license
- **Read and accept the [Terms and Conditions](https://mzio.io/general-terms-and-conditions/)**

After clicking the register button, a verification email is sent to the provided address. This can
take
a few minutes.

1. Please open the email
2. Click the verification link that redirects to the user portal
3. Verify the email by **Click here to proceed** to verify your email
4. Return to mzmine and refresh the page (automatically done every 30 seconds)
5. Check your license status in mzmine. Every user will receive a 30-day trial license or a
   non-profit academic license. Please reach out if your academic institution still needs our
   automatic validation.

## Offline use

Sign in to your user in mzmine on a computer that is connected to the internet. Click on the menu
**User/Open users directory** to open the file explorer at your systems user/.mzmine/.users
directory.
Copy the corresponding users (.mzuser files) to the new system into the same directory.
Alternatively copy the files
to the other system and drag-and-drop them into mzmine. The users will be installed.
Finally, open the **Users/User management** and select the active user.

## User account console - changing user details

Open the [mzio user account console](https://auth.mzio.io/realms/mzio/account/) and sign in with
your user
credentials. Go to personal information to update any details. When changing the **email** the user
is automatically
logged out. On the next sign in, the user will receive another verification email to validate email
address ownership.
Revalidation of the email also triggers a revalidation of the **non-profit academic license**.

## Command-line interface (CLI)

Users can be logged in via command-line arguments to run mzmine in batch mode.
See [CLI tools](../commandline_tool.md) for more information.

## Alternative Sign in / Sign up

Alternatively users can register on the mzio.io
website [https://auth.mzio.io/realms/mzio/account](https://auth.mzio.io/realms/mzio/account/) by
clicking on the **Sign in** button in the top right corner.
Then follow the regular self-registration described above. Finally, users will need to sign in to
the mzmine software. If the sign in website does not load in mzmine, click
the ![btn_tool.png](img/btn_tool.png). Set a proxy and retry with the login screen but if this fails
try the alternative sign in by username and password directly. The mzmine CLI also provides the *
*-login-console** argument for alternative sign in.
