# Getting Started

Before creating your first project, we recommend setting up some things.

1. Set a temporary file directory. Go to _Project_ → _Set preferences_ → _Temporary file
   directory_. This requires a restart to take effect.
    2. We recommend setting the directory to an SSD with enough space for fast processing and
       visualizations.
    3. On Windows, old temporary files are deleted when a new session is started.
2. MZmine 2 projects cannot be imported due to changes in the data structure.
3. MZmine 2 batch files cannot be imported due to parameter optimizations.

You can get familiar with the new GUI here: [Main window overview](main-window-overview.md)

A quick insight to data processing workflows can be found
here: [LC-MS workflow](workflows/lcmsworkflow/lcms-workflow.md)
or [LC-IMS-IMS workflow](workflows/imsworkflow/ion-mobility-data-processing-workflow.md)

You can also check out the new processing wizard under _Processing wizard_ in the main menu.
