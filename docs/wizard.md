# Processing wizard
![mzwizard_logo](img/logo300_mzwizard.png)
The processing wizard reduces the configuration of complex standardized workflows into few
parameters. Those values are used to estimate or calculate all other parameters from spectral
processing over feature detection and alignment to annotation and data export. The mzwizard organizes
the different parts of the instrumental setup to define a workflow split up into: Sample
introduction, IMS, MS instrument, and workflow. Ideas for a workflow? We are open for
ideas and contributions. Feel free to reach out if your workflow might be a candidate for a wizard
setup.

:material-menu-open: **Processing wizard**

!!! tip
The mzwizard is split into sections, most importantly, the MS part and the sample introduction.
Parameters here reflect the sensitivity, resolution, and accuracy of these parts of the hyphenation.
Selecting one of the default presets actually populates the initial values.

!!! danger
The defaults are only suggestions and different acquisition methods and instruments produce
different noise levels etc. The **raw data overview** and **aligned feature lists** are useful to
optimize these parameters.

## [1] Data import

Specify all data files that need to be processed

## [2] Sample introduction system

!!! info
Depends on the selected sampling system, e.g. **MALDI**, **HPLC**, **DESI**

### Chromatography-based

#### Smoothing

Apply smoothing to the chromatograms. Smoothing should not be used for data low MS1 acquisition
rates (e.g. below 5 data points per chromatographic peak/feature).

Influences batch steps:
[Smoothing](module_docs/featdet_smoothing/smoothing.md)

#### Stable ionization across samples

Used during feature grouping of adducts and other ions of the same molecule. Only use if the
matrix (e.g., salt content, same culture medium, only fresh OR sea water samples) and ionization
efficiencies are comparable across the whole study.

Influences batch steps:
[Correlation grouping](module_docs/id_ion_networking/metacorr/metacorr.md)

#### Crop retention time

Crops the chromatograms at these retention time values. Useful to cut off the start and the end of
the chromatograms. The start is often diverted into the waist and the end often contains the cleanup
procedure.

#### Max peaks in chromatogram

An estimate of the number of isomers and isobaric ions in the chromatograms. Used to estimate the
percentage of data points that hold useful data for the feature resolving step. (Chromatographic
threshold in local minimum resolver).

Influences batch steps:

performed within each individual sample, usually leading to small variance.

Influences batch steps:
[Isotope grouping](module_docs/filter_isotope_filter/isotope_filter.md),
[Correlation grouping](module_docs/id_ion_networking/metacorr/metacorr.md)

## [3] Ion mobility instrument

#### Smoothing

Applies smoothing to the ion mobilograms. This should be enabled for long ramp times in TIMS
instruments.

Influences batch steps:
[Smoothing](module_docs/featdet_smoothing/smoothing.md#mobility-dimension)

#### Minimum consecutive scans

The number of consecutive scans/datapoints in a valid ion mobilogram and feature. Increase this for
longer ramps in TIMS instruments.

## [4] MS instrument, e.g., Orbitrap, QTOF, FTICR

#### Noise threshold (MS1/MS2)

Choose the mass detector from the drop down menu. Choose the **Factor of lowest signal** for both
centroided or profile data where each spectrum contains noise signals, often represented by many
signals at the same low intensity (spectral grass). This may correspond to static noise or single
counts. If the spectra are free of noise, for example
because they were already filtered, use an **absolute intensity** threshold.

Depending on the selected mass detector, separate absolute noise levels or factors are defined to
threshold spectra of MS level 1 and 2 (or above). So the MS2 noise level is used for MSn data with
level > 1. These parameters can be optimized by looking at the spectral raw data in the raw data
overview.

Influences batch steps:
[Mass detection (MS1, MSn)](module_docs/featdet_mass_detection/mass-detection.md) 1/5th of the value
is used
for [ion mobility scans](terminology/ion-mobility-terminology.md#accumulations-mobility-scans-and-frames).

## [5] Filters

#### Original feature list

Options to either _keep_ or _remove_ the original feature lists. _Keep_ is valuable during workflow
optimization whereas _remove_ saves resources and allows for more performant processing or large
datasets. (See section on performance).

Influences batch steps:
all batch steps that create a new feature list.

#### Min samples per aligned feature

Only keep aligned features that were detected in at least n samples. This parameter should usually
scale with the sampleset size and if samples are relatively similar from their compounds. Uses the
maximum of an absolute and relative value.

Influences batch steps:

## [7] Workflows

Most of the parameters in the workflow section define data output and some workflow specific
parameters.

### General parameters

- Apply [spectral networking](module_docs/group_spectral_net/molecular_networking.md) (FBMN/IIMN): Will compare all MS2 spectra across features to form
  molecular networks by spectral similarity.
- Define an export path and base file name, e.g., *"D:\analysis\date_project"*  this will create a
  new folder and save all files from export modules there. Each module will add a specific suffix to
  the file name.
- Export for molecular networking (e.g., GNPS, FBMN, IIMN, MetGem): Will export all files for
  molecular networking
- Export for SIRIUS: Will export all files needed for SIRIUS
- Export annotation graphics: Exports annotations like spectral library matches, lipid matches, etc.
  to graphical reports. Contains options to also export chromatographic/ion mobility shapes, images,
  and other plots.

### Workflow parameters and descriptions

#### DDA

The data-dependent acquisition workflow is the default non target workflow. We recommend to also use
this workflow for targeted analysis and combine it with the [Local compound database search](module_docs/id_prec_local_cmpd_db/local-cmpd-db-search.md) or [Spectral library search](module_docs/id_spectral_library_search/spectral_library_search.md) annotation modules.

#### DIA

The data-independent acquisition workflow is can process any type of MSe, broad band CID, or all ion fragmentation experiments. Add a minimum DIA correlation coefficient and a minimum number correlated data points in of MS2 data points.

#### Library generation

More method and contributor **metadata** is required to build spectral libraries. This workflow
produces reference libraries with options to filter and merge spectra.
